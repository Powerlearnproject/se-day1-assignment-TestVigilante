Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

**Software engineering** is a discipline that involves designing, building web or mobile applications or systems and testing to fix and prevent bugs.

Software engineering helps in deigning user intuitive software applications and systems. Also it helps build fully functional software applications. Software engineering helps prevent and fix bugs in software applications to maintain quality, reliability and trust to users.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

- __Emergence of structured programming:__ Development of C language which became the foundation of system programming.
- __Rise of Object Oriented Programming:__ Emergence of objected-oriented programming languages like C++ and java enabled code reusabilty.
- __Emergence of Cloud Computing:__ Rise of cloud computing platforms like Google Cloud, Amazon Web Server (AWS) and Azure allows for scalabilty and accessibilty of software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

+ __Planning:__ This phase entails collection of requirements needed for development of a software application.
+ __Design:__ Usere interface Designers come up with better graphics for user interface designs necessary for the look and navigation of the software.
+ __Development:__ Software developers come up with code base that ensures th software application works as intended.
+ __Testing:__ Software testers get to test the software application to prevent or fix any bugs that may arise.
+ __Deployment:__ Software applicaion is deployed to appropriate operating environment for intended users to interact with it.
+ __Maintenance:__ Software updates are implemented incase of any future feature develpment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

**Waterfall methodology** is a linear, sequential approach where each phase/stage is unique and that a previous phase must be completed before moving to the next stage.

**Agile methodology** is iterative and flexible in nature as it allows continous feedback and adaptation to changing requirements through development process.

Agile embraces continous collaboration and adjustments based on feedbacks throughout the project whereas waterfall prioritizes thorough planning with limited flexibilty.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

**Software Developer** writes code to ensure functionality of a software application.

**Quality Assurance Engineer** tests the software for any possible bug whether in the user interface or business logic of the software application and fixes it.

**Project Manager** is responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects, ensurring they are within budget, completed on time and meet quality standards.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)** help in providing building and testing environments for different software projects. Examples of IDEs include Visual Studio Code and Android Studio.

**Version Control Systems (VCS)** help in managing different versions of our software. They also facilitate collaboration within the software development team.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- **Complex Problem Solving:** Software engineers often solve complex problems that require deep analytical thinking and creativity. Software engineers should break down problems into smaller chunks, used design patterns and also collaborate to help solve complex problems.

- **Maintaining Code Quality:** Ensuring that code is clean, maintainable, and scalable can be difficult, especially in large projects with multiple contributors. This can be solved by implementing a rigorous code review process, carry out automated tests and lastly adhere to coding standards and best practices to maintain consistency.

- **Time Management and Deadlines:** Balancing multiple tasks and meeting tight deadlines can be stressful and lead to burnout. To solve this, software engineers should prioritize projects based on urgency and importance.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

**Prompt Engineering** is the art of structuring commands or questions in a manner that leads to quality responses from AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

__Vague Prompt:__ Build a grocery Android app.

__Improved Prompt:__ Build a grocery Android app using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Firebase, Koin and Ktor that allows users to sign up and login, search and browse grocery items, checkout by making payment via Mpesa and track order status.

The improved prompt is more effective as we were clear and specific to what we wanted the AI model to do for us in regard to development of a grocery Android app.
